# Spotify_CLone

I designed a front page for a Spotify clone. It has a dark theme, showing album covers and playlists clearly. The layout includes a top menu, search bar, and popular music sections. Itâ€™s easy to navigate on both desktop and mobile, with simple hover effects to enhance user interaction. The design aims to feel just like Spotify, making it user-friendly and visually appealing.
